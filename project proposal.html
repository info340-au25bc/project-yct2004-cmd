    <h1>App Description</h1>
    <p>This application will help people who are unable to access informational spaces regarding Cybersecurity terminology and concepts.
        More specifically it aims to help students study for certifications such as the CompTIA Security+ while also forming groups that 
        can lead to lasting connection within the Cybersecurity community and therefore more opportunities for mentorship and career growth.
    </p>
    <p>In this app people will be able to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Get directed to free relevant Cybersecurity resources</li>
        <li>Create and join study groups</li>
        <li>Collaborate by making questions related to the sources they reviewed</li>
        <li>Get ranked and compete with others through a point system</li>
        <li>Give feedback in the event of a mistake by the question creator</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The type of resources that will be recommended by the app will be videos, articles and textbooks recommended by experts in the field.
        An example would be the <a href="https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-601/sy0-601-training-course/">Professor Messer Security+ Course</a>
        Which is a highly rated collection of free videos that cover all the topics needed to pass the Security+ exam. Another example would be the
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CompTIA-Security-Certification-SY0-601/dp/1264268749">CompTIA Security+ Study Guide</a> which is a highly rated textbook 
        that covers all the topics needed to pass the Security+ exam.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>To help people who are new to Cybersecurity get access to free resources that will help them learn the basics</li>
        <li>To create a community of learners that can help each other grow and succeed</li>
