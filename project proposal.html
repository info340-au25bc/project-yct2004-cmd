            <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
            <p>
                Cybersecurity awareness represents a critical challenge in our increasingly digital world, where individuals and organizations face constant threats from phishing attacks, malware, social engineering, and data breaches. Despite the growing sophistication of cyber threats, many people lack fundamental knowledge about online safety practices, password security, and recognizing common attack vectors. According to the <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/" target="_blank">2023 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report</a>, 74% of breaches involve human error, highlighting a significant gap in cybersecurity literacy across all demographics. This knowledge deficit affects everyone from students and remote workers to small business owners, making cybersecurity education not just a technical issue but a social imperative.

            <p>
                The information technology problem in this space is the lack of accessible, engaging, and personalized tools for both delivering and assessing cybersecurity knowledge. While corporate training programs exist, they're often expensive and inaccessible to individual learners. Educational resources are frequently static and don't provide interactive ways to test comprehension or track improvement over time. Existing solutions like KnowBe4 and SANS Security Awareness focus primarily on enterprise clients with subscription models, while free resources like <a href="https://phishingquiz.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank">Google's Phishing Quiz</a> or the National Cyber Security Centre's online materials offer limited interactivity and no community-driven content creation. There's a gap for a platform that democratizes both the creation and consumption of cybersecurity knowledgeâ€”allowing security professionals, educators, or experienced users to share their expertise through custom quizzes while enabling learners to assess their vulnerabilities and track their progress through competitive scoring and ranking systems.
